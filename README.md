For this homework I developed an artist portfolio that utilized images already located on the web.  I decided to style the project using a background image to be universal on every page and added transparent properties whenever needed.  I used a navbar header to drop down the page locations and styled appropriately.  I added a footer that links to my social media (FB, Instagram, LinkedIn).  I ran into issues and had to add media queries to assist with the changing shape of the background image as well as the toggler color so that it was more visible on smaller platforms.

When I began the project I was using a different repositoy labeled "Homework-2".  I recieved feedback after my last assignment to come up with more creative names for my repositories so I started a new repository for this project, deleting the old repository.  I realized that wasn't the most intelligent decision as it erased my commit history.  That is why this folder only has 2 commits.  Woops!  I will commit my future assignments more frequently and change the repository name instead of deleting the repository entirely.

Thank you!
